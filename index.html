        While making this project, we went through a lot of trial and error. At first, it may have seemed like a simple sound project—at the beginning, players could only play the sounds uploaded by the user. But we eventually added a twist: you can now play the notes of a piano. Initially, we focused on the piano, making it the centerpiece of the project, though other instruments are included mostly for fun. I (Nish) was in charge of the coding, and I wanted to give players a demo to try. I couldn’t find a suitable MIDI file, so I ended up creating the beats myself. It's not perfect, but I hope you enjoy it!
